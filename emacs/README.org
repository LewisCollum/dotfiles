* Run =setup=
  All the following steps can be simplified by running ~./setup~
  located in the =emacs= directory.

* Cask Installation
	Install Cask from your package manager or using these instructions: https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/installation.html

	Create a =cask_location.el= file in the =.emacs.d= directory and set the ~cask_location~ to the directory where =cask.el= resides. Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq cask_location "/usr/share/cask/cask.el")
#+END_SRC

	This will give your =init.el= file a place to initialize cask from.

* Theme - Xresources
	You can reference the Xresources file from my [[https://github.com/LewisCollum/dotfiles/blob/master/xorg/Xresources][dotfiles]] repository.
  
	Wherever you put your Xresources file, make sure to merge it. Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
xrdb -merge ~/Xresources	 
#+END_SRC
	 
* Create =custom.el=
	Create an empty =custom.el= file in the =.emacs.d= directory. This
	file will contain the custom variables and faces that are
	*auto-generated* when you use emacs' customize- commands.
